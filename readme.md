## Mongoose: Choose Your Own Resource

You're going to combine your knowledge of express, mongo and mongoose to build an application that has full CRUD on a resource of your choice.  You've done this with authors, puppies, and countries so far.  It's up to you.


* Your resource must have at least 4 fields.
* It's fine to reference old code, but you must start from scratch
* Focus on understanding every single line of code that you write


### Bonus

- Style your application using bootstrap or custom css(if you want to do this, remember to use `express.static`)
